In this project, we try to implement an NLP Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets. We will be classifying the tweets into positive or negative sentiments. 
For data preprocessing, we will be using Natural Language Processingâ€™s (NLP) NLTK library.
The dataset provided is the Sentiment140 Dataset which consists of 1,600,000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API. The various columns present in this Twitter data are:
>target: the polarity of the tweet (positive or negative)
>ids: Unique id of the tweet
>date: the date of the tweet
>flag: It refers to the query. If no such query exists, then it is NO QUERY.
>user: It refers to the name of the user that tweeted
>text: It refers to the text of the tweet
***Note: The Sentiment140 Dataset is available on Kaggle. The file was too big to be added to repository.
